A little less conversation, a little more action...

## Welcome

Thanks for checking out my new blog! This site is meant to be my playground on the web. The whole point of this site is for me to have an avenue for expression and to share the goofy (i.e. nerdy) things I'm working on :)

## New Year, New Goals

I had a truly original idea at the beginning of this year: I should set some goals for myself. Nay, resolutions. Novel, right? Those goals are to:

1. Be Prolific
2. Get Involved in the Las Vegas Downtown Project
3. Go all out for Costume Parties

Confession: #3 is my favorite.

I also had the idea that I wanted to create a font. So I purchased this domain, which is actually a play on the word "dilettante." But after I started working on a custom font, I realized what I truly wanted to do was hand lettering, just like those cool kids over at [Friends of Type](http://friendsoftype.com), and that I had picked the perfect domain name.

I'm hoping to chronicle my adventures at achieving these three goals. In fact, this blog is part of #1. Ka-kow.

## The Setup

My portfolio site is written in PHP using Wordpress, and it's a setup that works just fine. But it didn't feel quite right. I'm a Front End Developer at heart, and a lover of all things JavaScript. Furthermore, I'm fairly terrible with databases. I am, however, marginally competent with git.

So I wrote this blog using NodeJS. It's currently using Wheat as the blog engine, which is, for a geek, super cool. Basically, Wheat takes a git repository and turns it into a blog! What what!? 

Visually, I'm using the default skin from [Howtonode.org](http://howtonode.org). That will change. Hoping to do more iteration than perfection.

And, as OAR says, "It's 2am and I want to go to be-he-head.j So that's what I'll do. More tech details and posts to come! I bet you can barely container yourself ;)
