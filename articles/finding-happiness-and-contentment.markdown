A few thoughts after attending a short talk and guided meditation with Bhante Sujatha.

## Meditation is easy and peaceful

After a short and humorous introduction, Bhante Sujatha asked the attendees what our experience had been with meditation. Three people raised their hands and answered. The first two said that time flew by while meditating. The third mentioned how peaceful meditation is.

I find these to be common responses to such a question. However, while I've experienced those feelings, and find a great deal of peace from my meditation practice, that certainly isn't the norm for me *during* meditation. I relate it more to weight lifting than relaxation. Like weight lifting, meditation is hard work, but the long-term payoff is huge.

## Cultivation of the mind

Bhante Sujatha said that meditation had been misinterpreted in the western world as being solely about tranquility, or finding yourself in a trance. The true meaning for meditation practice, or bhavana, is the cultivation of the mind.

In fact, I rarely find my mind completely at peace during meditation, and from what I've found, that's a blessing. Why, you might ask? First, it gives me the opportunity to forgive myself for my failings. I'm not exactly easy on myself, and any opportunity I have to forgive myself for my shortcomings and treat myself with kindness is a gift.

Second, it gives me the opportunity to recognize how easy it is to get swept away in the river of thought. Most of the time that's quite fun, such as when I'm geeking out about Arduino sensors or unit testing. But there are times when it can be quite destructive, such as when I let doubt and negativity creep into my life. At those times, it's important to recognize that I'm not at peace. That I've stopped paying attention to the beauty right in front of me. And it gives me an opportunity to reorient myself.

If I didn't work hard during meditation, I wouldn't be able to see my mind wander. Without those repeated experiences, I wouldn't be able to short-circuit negativity. Certainly, I'm not 100% successful at doing that, but I'm leaps and bounds better than I was before I started meditation.

## The essence of meditation

Bhante Sujatha then described the essence of meditation as following the breath, and explained three criteria for success:

1. Awareness
2. Presence
3. Non-Judgement

The first two are no joke. Take five minutes to be aware of your thoughts and emotions as they occur, and I bet you'll find your mind and body have as much control over you as you do over them. We have millions of processes that occur every second without conscious thought. That thought alone humbles me.

Furthermore, from my experience, being present all the time is nearly impossible. It's so easy to get lost in thought, and those thoughts are almost always about the past or future -- never the present moment. What happened earlier in the week and how you feel about it. An argument with a coworker, or a beautiful moment with someone you love. Your plans and how your going to confront a certain situation in the future.

But for as difficult as the first two are, non-judgement is probably the most difficult for me. I generally find myself quite good at non-judgement of others. As a person who was picked on rather relentlessly as a kid, I have a natural aversion to criticizing others in a mean-spirited way. But I am pretty damn good at being mean to myself. While I know I need to work on the first two parts of this trifecta, I feel the third may be the most important to me personally.

## Do not struggle, deal with

Another interesting portion of Bhante Sujatha's talk for me was his portion about the constant struggle that inherent in life. I love the phrase "Beautiful Struggle," which was coined by Martin Luther King, Jr. It's such a wonderful and vivid description of how we live our lives. Despite all the pain and difficulty we face every day, life is an amazing gift.

Bhante Sujatha suggested we move past this notion of struggle and onto the notion of dealing with the difficulties in our life. I'm not sure I completely agree. Without struggle, I do not think we'd have true growth. However, I'm not sure Bhante Sujatha would disagree with my statement, and this is probably a semantic difference between the way we interpret these words.

## Letting go and not clinging

Finally, Bhante Sujtaha talked about our need to cling and our inability to let go. This one struck home for me, as it's something I've been dealing with lately. It's painful for me not to cling to the people and objects I so dearly love. Personally, I never want to let go. I want to soak in the all the beauty and mystery they have to offer.

But clinging tightly cuts me off from that beauty. It turns my favorite people and activities into a means to an end. Instead of appreciating all they have to offer and seeing them for who and what they truly are, I worry about myself and how amazing they make me feel. I don't want to give myself too hard a time for this, but it's something I would like to work on.
